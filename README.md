# Custom Printf Function for ALX Software School

![ALX Software School Logo](https://alxintrotoswe.com/img/alx-logo.svg)

This repository contains a custom implementation of the `printf` function as part of the ALX Software School curriculum. The goal of this project is to develop our own version of the `printf` function that can handle a variety of format specifiers and produce formatted output.

## Project Description

The `printf` function is a fundamental function in the C programming language used to format and print text and other data types. In this project, we are tasked with creating our own version of this function. The implementation includes parsing the format string for various specifiers and converting and printing the corresponding values.

## Usage

To use our custom `printf` function, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/preshengr/printf.git
   ```

2. Include the `printf` header in your C program:

   ```c
   #include "printf.h"
   ```

3. Call the `custom_printf` function in your code:

   ```c
   int main() {
       custom_printf("Hello, %s! The answer is %d.\n", "Developer", 42);
       return 0;
   }
   ```

4. Compile your code and run the executable:

   ```sh
   gcc -o my_program my_program.c printf.c
   ./my_program
   ```

## Supported Format Specifiers

Our custom `printf` implementation currently supports the following format specifiers:

- `%s` : String
- `%c` : Character
- `%d` : Integer
- `%f` : Floating-point number
- `%x` : Hexadecimal

Refer to the C standard documentation for more information on format specifiers.
